# Bigger world exploratory experiments

Replicates previous class 1, 2, 3, 4 matrix experiments but using a larger world size.
So far, we haven't seen much of an effect of spatial structure.
One possibility is that our world size could also be too small to see an effect of spatial structure given the number of model updates we're running.
