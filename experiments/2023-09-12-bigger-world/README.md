# Bigger world exploratory experiments

Replicates previous class 1, 2, 3, 4 matrix experiments but using a larger world size.
So far, we haven't seen much of an effect of spatial structure.
One possibility is that our world size could also be too small to see an effect of spatial structure given the number of model updates we're running.

Takeaways:

- Spatial structure can matter

Followups:

- Play with comet kite parameters to see if changes kind of line up with
  - MÃ¶ller, M., Hindersin, L. & Traulsen, A. Exploring and mapping the universe of evolutionary graphs identifies structural properties affecting fixation probability and time. Commun Biol 2, 137 (2019).
- Compare actual compositions of communities found across spatial structures
  - Are they the same communities?
- Could do transplants. I.e., does a community's success depend on the spatial structure?
- "Competition" experiments - invasion experiments
- Look at dynamics over time
